0.2.0

Added:
-- Added support for secondary DICOM files.
-- Added support for single frame images which contain the tag (0028,0008), which is supposed to be reserved for multi-frame images according to the DICOM standard.
-- Added support for generating JSON with the correct protocol for both single and multi-frame DICOM images, however this is currently unused (see changes).

Changed:
-- Multi-frame images will not appear in the viewer when View Study is clicked, as they currently do not load correctly.

Multi frame image support should come shortly.


0.1.0
