0.3.0

Added:
-- Added a new REST call "/xapi/viewer/generate-all-metadata" which will generate the viewer metadata for every experiment in the database. This is only useable by an admin.
currently this must be invoked by the URL or the command line, but will be soon added to the administer tools.

Changed:
-- Multithreaded the server code such that each POST uses a seperate thread when multiple JSON files need to be written (as in "/xapi/viewer/generate-all-metadata").


0.2.0

Added:
-- Added support for secondary DICOM files.
-- Added support for single frame images which contain the tag (0028,0008), which is supposed to be reserved for multi-frame images according to the DICOM standard.
-- Added support for generating JSON with the correct protocol for both single and multi-frame DICOM images, however this is currently unused (see changes).

Changed:
-- Multi-frame images will not appear in the viewer when View Study is clicked, as they currently do not load correctly.

Multi frame image support should come shortly.


0.1.0

Basic functionality, the viewer is correctly linked and interfaced with XNAT. Although not yet feature rich the plugin is useable.
