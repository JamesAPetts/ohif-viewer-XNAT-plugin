1.1.1
-- Tightened security of API for all possible account types.

1.1.0
-- Changed posting JSON to require EDIT.


1.0.1
Fixed:
-- Fixed an issue loading the xmodal iframe in the new single plugin deployment when routing through a proxy using https.


1.0.0
Changed:
-- Single plugin deployment. The plugin is now one plug-and-play jar file.
-- Rewrote the routing section of the OHIF viewer such that the application can be embedded within the plugin jar.
-- Automatic routing configuration for XNATs running on both root and on extention of a Tomcat server.


0.5.0
-- Added server side event listeners to automate JSON generation on session upload/modification.
-- Removed need for setting up of automation scripts.


0.4.0

-- Removed the requirement for the "Sync Viewer" button.
-- Added a Groovy script to automate server side JSON generation whenever new images are uploaded or removed. This requires setup by an admin. Please check the README for instructions.


0.3.1

Added:
-- Series level JSONification and the ability to read only series from the viewer application, however this is not currently wired up to the XNAT UI (yet is functional).

Changed:
-- Improved Multithreaded code to use a threadpool with size equal to the number of threads on the server machine to avoid a clog up of IO opperations on large databases.
-- Fixed an issue introduced in 0.3.0 whereby single experiment/series JSONification would instantiate a single new Thread rather than opperating on the active thread processing the API request.


0.3.0

Added:
-- Added a new REST call "/xapi/viewer/generate-all-metadata" which will generate the viewer metadata for every experiment in the database. This is only useable by an admin.
currently this must be invoked by the URL or the command line, but will be soon added to the administer tools.

Changed:
-- Multithreaded the server code such that each POST uses a seperate thread when multiple JSON files need to be written (as in "/xapi/viewer/generate-all-metadata").


0.2.0

Added:
-- Added support for secondary DICOM files.
-- Added support for single frame images which contain the tag (0028,0008), which is supposed to be reserved for multi-frame images according to the DICOM standard.
-- Added support for generating JSON with the correct protocol for both single and multi-frame DICOM images, however this is currently unused (see changes).

Changed:
-- Multi-frame images will not appear in the viewer when View Study is clicked, as they currently do not load correctly.

Multi frame image support should come shortly.


0.1.0

Basic functionality, the viewer is correctly linked and interfaced with XNAT. Although not yet feature rich the plugin is useable.
